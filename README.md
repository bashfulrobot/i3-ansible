Ansible script to setup i3 on the Ubuntu mini.iso

## STATUS

This is still an active work in progress. It may change, it may break as I work through it.

## How to Use

## Default Config Notes

I'm just casually documenting some of the default software that people may not be used to (for a default).

- zsh shell w/ oh-my-zsh
- p10k prompt
- `nmtui` used to cfg the network.
